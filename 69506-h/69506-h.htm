<p>Charles Crossley, President of American Jet-Propelled Ships, felt
himself spread-eagled in his favorite living room chair. The voice
on the televisor moaned. Europe. Crossley twitched. Secret atomic
factories. Crossley jerked. Semi-dictatorships. Crossley sweated.
Political pressures. War. Crossley writhed.</p>

<p>His wife shut the televisor off indignantly. "Nonsense!" She stared
at her limp husband. "Tri-Union hasn't any weapons, we haven't any,
neither has Russia, Britain or anyone else. That was all settled and
forbidden ages ago. When was it? 1960?"</p>

<p>Crossley stroked his receding hairline, sighing. "They're making atom
bombs in secret," he said. He littered the rug with cigar ash.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" cried his wife. "My nice rug!"</p>

<p>"The rug, oh, the confounded rug," he said, and muttered away, closing
his eyes for a long minute. Then he opened one eye. He looked at his
wife. He looked at the rug, the cigar in his hand, the fallen ashes.</p>

<p>"The rug?" He shut his eyes again. Five minutes later he leaped up with
an explosion of sound. "The rug! I've got it! I've <i>got</i> it!" He
seized his wife, kissed her. "You <i>are</i> brilliant! I love you!
That's it, that <i>is</i> it!"</p>

<p>He rushed madly off in the general direction of Europe!</p>

<p>Thus began the Tri-Union-American war of the year 1989.</p>

<p>The small jet-propelled ship crossed the Atlantic in fiery gusts. In
it was Charles Crossley, a man with an idea. Behind it three thousand
other ships tore along, putting space behind. They were his ships. They
belonged to his company. He employed the men. This was his own private
war.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Mr. Crossley laughed quite obviously.</p>

<p>The radio cut in on him. "Crossley?"</p>

<p>Crossley answered. "Speaking."</p>

<p>"This is the President, Crossley." The voice was sharp, and it fairly
heated the interior of the ship. "Turn back, in the name of common
sense. What <i>are</i> you up to! I'll seize your company!"</p>

<p>"This can't wait, Mr. President. We've been sweating it out for months.
The Tri-Union won't admit it's setting up a fascistic skeleton in
Europe, we can't find any proof they are, but there are rumors. We've
got to get it out in the open. We can't wait. I'm sorry I have to act
alone. Bombardiers?"</p>

<p>"Ready!" Three thousand voices.</p>

<p>"Crossley!" shouted the President, far away.</p>

<p>"Here comes Vienna!" Crossley jerked his hand down. "Bombloads,
release!"</p>

<p>"Release!" Three thousand voices.</p>

<p>"Crossley!" The President.</p>

<p>"Bang!" said Crossley.</p>

<p>Pink confetti tumbled down through the clear cool summer air. Tons
and tons of pink, whirling confetti! Confetti by the bombload, three
thousand cargoes of very pink, very fine confetti!</p>

<hr class="chap">

  <div class="caption">Pink confetti tumbled down through the air.</div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>"And to think," mused Crossley happily, as he turned his ship homeward,
"to think the entire idea came from spilling ashes on the rug! Hi-ho!"</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The President of the United States shook his fist.</p>

<p>"You bombed them!"</p>

<p>Crossley yawned. "There is no law against dropping waste paper," he
said, quietly.</p>

<p>"You attacked the people of the Tri-Union states!"</p>

<p>"No one injured," said Crossley, calmly. "No explosions, no bruises, no
fatalities. Did anybody even get a piece of confetti in his eye? The
answer is no. A two letter word."</p>

<p>Crossley lit a cigarette. "Fifty thousand housefraus and one hundred
thousand children swept sidewalks. Men flooded employment offices
in Vienna for street sweeper jobs. But, ah, that clever, devilish
confetti! It was electrically and chemically impregnated. It vanished
when touched by human hands. It reappeared when humans withdrew from
the immediate vicinity. Brooms helped little. When disturbed the
confetti had a curious habit of jumping like tiddle-de-winks or jumping
beans. Sensitive little things. I dare say it'll be some weeks before
Vienna is clean. That is what I have done to the Tri-Union. The World
Organization forbids an attack. Was this an attack, sir? Confetti on
the wind? Eh?"</p>

<p>"The World Organization forbids war!" cried the President.</p>

<p>"This is not war." Crossley leaned forward, tapped the desk earnestly.
"Suppose we dropped confetti every day, causing the Tri-Union
population to pluck and curry their lawns 365 days a year? And there
are <i>other</i> things we can do, Mr. President. Little, irritating
things. Imagine it, Mr. President, will you?"</p>

<p>The President imagined it for quite awhile. Then, slowly, he began to
smile.</p>

<p>It was a sweet day, a morning in the Tri-Union state of Bruegher. The
sky was blue, the clouds were nicely white. And upon the rolling green
hills a picnic was spread, with thousands of tossed paper napkins,
hundreds of bread heels, crusts, can openers, sardine tins, dropped
eggs and wadded cardboard cartons. The picnic, like a river of several
thousand parts, engulfed the park-like hills. One small boy running
through the dells paused to leave his semi-digested lunch.</p>

<p>Laughter. Wine bottles gurgling! Songs!</p>

<p>The President of the United States and Mr. Crossley clinked glasses,
heading the picnic, drank gustily, refilled, drank again. Others
yelled, screamed in delight, played tag, threw away bottles!</p>

<p>And on twenty thousand other Tri-Union hills twenty thousand other
small family ships landed. Twenty thousand more picnic riots began.
Sixty thousand napkins, well wadded, were dropped from wiped lips! One
hundred thousand shattered egg shells were spilled! Sixty thousand
shiny soup cans were left gleaming in the sun. Three hundred million
ants rushed out to welcome them. And the 30 million people of Greater
Bruegher glared at the invasion, knowing not what to do. What was the
world coming to?</p>

<p>At nightfall, the last little boy had emptied himself of his brackish
contents, the last little girl plucked bawling from a poison ivy nest,
the last sardine dispatched, the last beer bottle left a foamy vacuum.</p>

<p>Flying away into the night, the American invaders sent back their war
cry which sounded remarkably like, and probably was, a belch.</p>

<p>General Krauss, personal representative of Brugh, the new semi-dictator
of Europe, shouted out of the televisor:</p>

<p>"Mr. President, you, <i>you</i> were seen, by reliable witnesses, to
peel an egg and, bit by bit, throw the shell under a one hundred year
old linden tree!"</p>

<p>Crossley and the President stood together in the White House inner
sanctum. The President spoke:</p>

<p>"Krauss, the peace laws specify no nation may manufacture weapons for
killing, wounding or destruction of another's national populace or
property. We are helpless to attack you, therefore. All the while, you,
in secret, make weaponsâ€”"</p>

<p>"You can't prove that!"</p>

<p>"â€”make weapons," said the President, grimly. "So, in last recourse, we
use weapons which are no weapons at all. We have destroyed nothing and
no one."</p>

<p>"Ah-hah!" Krauss' eyes snapped on the visor. His face vanished. A new
scene replaced it, showing a green meadow. Krauss' voice crackled
behind it, in comment. "Property damage to Greater Bruegher! Listen!
Rough estimate! Sixty-five thousand ants, large and small, both black
and red, biting and non-biting, were trodden on at your picnic!"</p>

<p>The scene dissolved to yet another.</p>

<p>"Hark! Ten million grass-blades. Approximately. Ten million trampled
and crushed. Two thousand pretty flowers. Picked!"</p>

<p>"That was an error," apologized Crossley. "The children got out of
hand."</p>

<p>"Two thousand flowers," repeated Krauss savagely. "<i>Picked!</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Krauss took time to get hold of himself. He cleared his throat and
continued.</p>

<p>"Approximately thirty billion atomic particles of wood brushed off
Great Bruegher sycamores, oaks, elms and lindens by adults playing tree
tagâ€”ANDâ€”sixty million particles scraped from Greater Bruegher fences
by young men escaping angered Greater Bruegher bulls. AND! Andâ€”" he
thundered. The scene dissolved once more, and a most interesting view
was revealed. "Andâ€”sixteen thousand cubic feet of A-1, first class
forest moss crushed, rolled upon and otherwise malpracticed by young
lovers idling in the thickets! There you are! The proof! The proof!
This is war!"</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The first Tri-Union airships flew over New York a week later. From
them, on parachutes, little yellow boxes floated.</p>

<p>Crossley, in his garden resting, preparing new methods of attack on the
enemy, was astonished as one of the devices hovered by the red brick
garden wall.</p>

<p>"A bomb!" he cried, and leaped into the house, sorry he had started
this infernal war.</p>

<p>Edith, his wife, peered from the rear window.</p>

<p>"Oh, come back," she said. "It's only a radio."</p>

<p>They listened. Music. Blues music.</p>

<p>"From back in the Mad Forties, when I wore pigtails," said Edith.</p>

<p>"Hmm," said Crossley.</p>

<p>The music, if such it could be called, concerned a lady afflicted with
"â€”I got those mad about him, glad about him, but I get so sad about
him bah-looze!"</p>

<p>"Interesting," said Crossley.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>The song ended. They waited.</p>

<p>The song began again.</p>

<p>"Is that all it plays?" said Edith. "I don't see any dials to change
the record with."</p>

<p>"<i>Oh</i>, oh," said Crossley and shut his eyes. "I think I begin to
see the lightâ€”"</p>

<p>The song ended and started a third time.</p>

<p>"That's what I expected," said Crossley. "Here, give me a hand."</p>

<p>The song flowed into its fourth, fifth and sixth renditions as they
poked at the dangling machine. It dodgedâ€”like a hummingbird.
"Radar-sensitives," gasped Crossley, giving up. "Oh, pfui!"</p>

<p>Edith covered her ears with her hands. "Oh, Charles," she said.</p>

<p>They went in the house and shut the door tight and shut the windows
tighter. Nevertheless, the music penetrated.</p>

<p>After dinner, Crossley looked at Edith and said:</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> make it?"</p>

<p>She counted on her fingers. "This next time will be the one hundred and
thirteenth repeat," she said.</p>

<p>"That's what I counted," said he, handing her wads of cotton.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He worked feverishly that evening. He made plans for war using
confetti, toothpaste tubes that refused to function, a chemical that
dulled razors with the first scrape, andâ€”mmm, let me see....</p>

<p>His young son, age twelve, was doing his homework in the next room.</p>

<p>"Oblivious to that awful music," said Crossley in admiration. "Kids are
marvels, can concentrate anywhere." He crept up on his son, looked over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>The boy was writing a composition:</p>

<p>"Poe authored The Cask of Amontillado, Masque of the Red Death, and I
Got Those Mad About Him, Glad About Him, But I Get So Sad About Himâ€”"</p>

<p>"Blues," said Crossley. He turned. "Edith! Pack the suitcases! We're
leaving home!"</p>

<p>They piled into the family helicopter. As the helicopter lifted into
the sky, Crossley's small son said, looking down at the music box in
the garden, "Two hund-derth time!"</p>

<p>Crossley hit him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was useless to flee. The hovering radios were everywhere, bawling.
They were in the air and on the ground and under bridges.</p>

<p>They could not be shot down; they dodged. And the music played on.</p>

<p>Edith glared at her husband who was somewhat responsible for all this.
His son tentatively eyed Crossley's shins for kicking.</p>

<p>Crossley called the President.</p>

<p>"YOU!" screamed the President. "CROSSLEY!"</p>

<p>"Mr. President, I can <i>explain</i>!"</p>

<p>So the war progressed. The World Organization hunched forward tensely
awaiting the moment when either side got off bounds, fired a shot or
committed a murder. Butâ€”</p>

<p>Normal civilized pursuits continued. Imports and exports flowed, foods,
clothing, raw materials were exchanged.</p>

<p>If either country had broken relations, made guns, knives, grenades,
the World Organization would have leaped in. But not a gun was
fashioned, not a knife sharpened. There were no murders, wounded, or
bruised. The World Organization was helpless. There was no war.</p>

<p>Well, almost none.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>"Heinrich!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my wife?"</p>

<p>"Come look at this mirror!"</p>

<p>Heinrich, chief deputy of the police department in a Greater Bruegher
village, came slopping in his easy slippers, holding his clay pipe like
a small tame bird in his hand.</p>

<p>Heinrich looked into a mirror that was ridiculous, like at a carnival.</p>

<p>"What has happened to it over night?" he wondered. "Look at me. Ha,
I look like an idiot!" He chuckled. "My face stretches like rubber,
shivers, is distorted. Well. The mirror is warped."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> are warped!" shouted his wife. "Do something about it!"</p>

<p>"I will buy a new one. In the meantime, the one upstairsâ€”"</p>

<p>"Is also warped!" she snapped. "How will I get my hat on straight, or
see if my lipstick is drawn fine, or my powder neat? Clumsy idiot,
hurry and fetch a new one! Go, get, rush!"</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Crossley had his orders. Find a way out. Or arrange a truce. If these
next attacks by the United States did not produce results the United
States must bargain for peace. Peace, yes. Peace from that abominable
woman singing the abominable blues twenty times an hour, night and
day. The American Public would hold the line as long as possible, said
the President, but time was short and puncturing everybody's eardrums
seemed a most unlikely way out. Crossley was to get in there, and pitch.</p>

<p>Crossley pitched. His jet plane streaked over Europe in the great
offensive. Three thousand bombloads of something or other were dropped,
at his order, and then the three thousand company ships curved and shot
home. He lingered on, cruising the length of Europe, awaiting results.</p>

<p>He got them.</p>

<p>A large, unseeable beam took hold of his ship and drew it steadily
down into the dark mountains of Greater Bruegher.</p>

<p>"Well," said Crossley. "Adventure."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The entire capture was quiet, convivial. When he stepped from his
grounded craft he was politely escorted into a city of ultra-modern
buildings and avenues between the mountains, and there, in a small
edifice, in a small room, he met his enemy.</p>

<p>Krauss sat behind a desk as Crossley entered. Crossley nodded and bowed.</p>

<p>"Hello, Krauss. You'll be prosecuted for kidnapping."</p>

<p>"You're free to go any time," snapped Krauss. "This is an interview.
Sit."</p>

<p>The chair was shaped like a low pyramid. You could sit, but you slid in
all directions. The ceiling, where Crossley was expected to sit, was
very low. He had to choose between back-ache or slithering around on a
pyramidal chair. He chose to slither.</p>

<p>Krauss reached over and pinched Crossley.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" said Crossley.</p>

<p>Krauss did it again.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" said Crossley.</p>

<p>"All right," said Krauss.</p>

<p>Under Crossley, the chair exploded.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Gibbering, Crossley leapt up. He banged his head on the ceiling. He
held his back end with one hand, the head with the other.</p>

<p>"Mr. Crossley, shall we talk of peace?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," said Crossley, bent over. "When you stop making secret weapons.
Otherwise, more confetti, more picnics and pigs-knuckles."</p>

<p>"And more music in America, ah, Mr. Crossley?"</p>

<p>Another pinch.</p>

<p>"Ow! We can stand the music long enough to use our next weapon. We
always did have it over you stuffed-shirts over here. You were the
inventors of psychological warfare, but we gave it a few improvements."</p>

<p>"Can one improve over music, Mr. Crossley?"</p>

<p>"We'll find a way. Ouch. Keep that away from me!"</p>

<p>"I'll detail our plans, Crossley. First, an oversupply of mosquitoes,
in America. <i>Hungry ones.</i> Then, a chemical which causes all men's
shoes to squeak with each step. Third, electrical pulses to make alarm
clocks ring an hour early each mornâ€”"</p>

<p>Crossley was professionally interested.</p>

<p>"Not bad. All within the Peace Rules. All harmless. Mmm, except those
mosquitoes."</p>

<p>"Merely skin irritatives."</p>

<p>"Still, the World Org might rule against it."</p>

<p>"Out with the mosquitoes, then!"</p>

<p>"Ouch."</p>

<p>"Did I <i>hurt</i> you? Sorry. Well, let us see if we can hurt you a
bit more. This paper on my desk. It is a radio report of your death
five minutes ago. Your plane crashed, says the report. I have only to
broadcast it, and then make sure you 'live' up to the facts contained
therein. You see?"</p>

<p>Crossley grinned. "I'm to report to the President every hour. No
report, immediate World Org investigation. Do <i>you</i> see?"</p>

<p>"Your plane crashed."</p>

<p>"No soap. The Brindly-Connors motors never conk. And the new
reactive-propellants on my ships prevent bad landings. So."</p>

<p>Krauss fidgeted. "We'll think of <i>some</i> way."</p>

<p>"It's time for me to phone the President; may I?"</p>

<p>"Here." A phone was handed him.</p>

<p>Crossley took the phone. Electricity shot up his arm, into his chest.</p>

<p>"Jeepers!" He dropped the thing. "I'll report you!"</p>

<p>"You have no proof. We both play this irritation game, do we not? Go
ahead. The phone."</p>

<p>This time, Crossley got the President:</p>

<p>"Crossley, you've heard the news, have you?"</p>

<p>"What news, sir?"</p>

<p>"The chewing gum, you moron, the chewing gum!"</p>

<p>"In the streets, sir?"</p>

<p>The President groaned. "In the streets, the roofs, the dog's fur, the
cars, the shrubs, everywhere! Big as golf-balls. And sticky!"</p>

<p>Krauss gloated, listening.</p>

<p>Crossley said, "Courage, Mr. President. Use the croquet hoops."</p>

<p>"Croquet hoops?" Krauss seized Crossley's arm.</p>

<p>"Invisible croquet hoops," Crossley smiled.</p>

<p>"No." Krauss triumphed. "People will stumble, be hurt, even killed by
them. The Word Org would stop you!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Crossley. His face fell. "Look, Mr. President. About those
hoops. Forget them. Proceed with Plan 40 and 45 instead."</p>

<p>Another phone rang. Krauss picked it up, answered it.</p>

<p><i>Your wife, Herr Krauss.</i></p>

<p>"All right, put her on."</p>

<p>"I'm okay, Mr. President. Had a little engine trouble."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p><i>Darling, the most terrible trouble!</i></p>

<p>"Katrina, I have no time. There is much to do."</p>

<p><i>This is important, you fool! It's horrible!</i></p>

<p>"Well, what is it, my liebschen? I'm busy."</p>

<p>"Answer me, Crossley, were you shot down?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, Mr. President. They're trying to figure out a way to kill
me. Haven't hit on one yet."</p>

<p>"Mr. Crossley, please, not so loud, I can't hear my wife talking. Yes,
darling?"</p>

<p><i>Hans, Hans, I have dandruff!</i></p>

<p>"Say that again, I have so much noise here, Katrina."</p>

<p>"I'll call you again in an hour, Mr. President."</p>

<p><i>Dandruff, Hans, dandruff. A thousand, five thousand flakes on my
shoulders!</i></p>

<p>"You call to tell me this, woman? Good-bye!"</p>

<p>BANG!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Crossley and Krauss hung up in unison, Krauss on his wife, Crossley on
the President.</p>

<p>"Where were we?" said Krauss, sweating.</p>

<p>"You were going to kill me. Remember?"</p>

<p>Again the phone. Krauss swore and answered. "What?"</p>

<p><i>Hans, I've gained ten pounds!</i></p>

<p>"Why do you insist on calling to tell me these things?"</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Leiber, Mrs. Krenschnitz and Mrs. Schmidst, they too have
gained ten pounds!</i></p>

<p>"Oh?" Krauss hung up, blinking. "So." He glared at Crossley. "That's
what it is. All right, Crossley, we, also, can be subtle. Doctor!"</p>

<p>A door slid open in the wall. There stood an evil looking rascal,
sleeves rolled high, testing a hypodermic on his own emaciated arm,
enjoying it. He looked up at Crossley and said:</p>

<p>"Practice."</p>

<p>"Get him!" cried Krauss.</p>

<p>Everybody jumped on Crossley.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Darkness.</p>

<p>"How do you feel, Crossley?"</p>

<p>How was he supposed to feel? All right, he guessed. He lifted himself
from a kind of operating table and looked at the doctor and at Krauss.</p>

<p>"Here Doctor," said Krauss. "Explain to Mr. Crossley what he may expect
ten years from now."</p>

<p>"Ten years?" said Crossley in alarm.</p>

<p>The doctor placed his thin fingers together, bowing. He whispered
daintily.</p>

<p>"Ten years from now you may expect aâ€”ahâ€”little trouble. It will
commence one year from now. Unobtrusively. Here or there a slight
gastric upset, a cardiac disturbance, a minor intra-irritation of the
lung sacs. Occasionally, a headache. A sallowness to the complexion, an
earache, perhaps."</p>

<p>Crossley began to sweat. He held onto his knees.</p>

<p>The doctor continued, slowly, pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"Then, as the years pass, a small flicker, like bird wings, of
the heart. A pain, as if stabbed in the groin. A twitching of the
peritoneum. A hot sweating, late of nights, drenching your bedclothes.
Insomnia. Night after night, cigarette after cigarette, headache after
headache."</p>

<p>"That'll do," said Crossley bleakly.</p>

<p>"No, no." The doctor waved his hypodermic. "I'm not finished. Temporary
blindness. I almost forgot that. Yes, temporary blindness. Fuzzy
lights in your head. Voices. Paralysis of the lower limbs. Then, your
heart, in one last explosion, lasting ten days, will beat itself into
a bruised pulp. And you'll die, exactlyâ€”" he consulted a mental
calendar, "â€”ten years, five months and fourteen days from today."</p>

<p>The silence in the room was touched only by Crossley's ragged
breathing. He tried to lift himself, shivered, fell back.</p>

<p>"Best of all, there will be no evidence of what we have done to you,"
said Krauss. "Certain hormones and molecular impurities were put into
your body. No analysis now or after death would reveal them. Your
health will simply fail. We will not be held responsible. Clever, is it
not?"</p>

<p>The doctor said, "You may go now. Now that we have fixed you, like a
time-bomb, to die later, you are free to go. We would not want to kill
you here, that would make us responsible. But, ten years from now, in
another place, how can that be due to us?"</p>

<p>The phone. "Your wife, Herr Krauss."</p>

<p><i>My hair is falling out!</i></p>

<p>"Now, now, be patient, my wife."</p>

<p><i>My skin is yellowing! Do something!</i></p>

<p>"I will be home in an hour."</p>

<p><i>There will be no home here, then, YOU!</i></p>

<p>"We must go on to Victory, my sweet."</p>

<p><i>Not on a path strewn with my golden, golden hair!</i></p>

<p>"Yes, my wife, I will say hello to the doctor for you."</p>

<p><i>Hans, don't you dare hang up on me. Don't you</i>â€”</p>

<p>Krauss sat down, fluttering his hands weakly. "My wife called me to say
all is well."</p>

<p>"Ha," said Crossley, weakly.</p>

<p>Krauss reached over and pinched him.</p>

<p>"Ouch."</p>

<p>"There," said Krauss. "Speak when you're spoken to."</p>

<p>Crossley stood up, laughing. The doctor looked at him as if he were
insane.</p>

<p>"I've got it. I'm going to commit suicide!"</p>

<p>"You're crazy," said Krauss.</p>

<p>"Ten years from now I die, so why not commit suicide here, thus
bringing an investigation by the World Organization, eh, Mr. Krauss?"</p>

<p>"You can't do that!" said Krauss, dumb-founded. "I won't permit it!"</p>

<p>"I'll jump off a building, perhaps. You can't hold me here for more
than another hour or the Organization will come to see what ticks. And
the minute you let me go, I'll jump off a building."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Or crash my ship, purposely, on the way home. Why not? What've I to
live for? And if it causes your trial, so much the better. Yes, I've
decided. I'll die."</p>

<p>"We'll hold him here," said the doctor to Krauss.</p>

<p>"We can't," said Krauss.</p>

<p>"Release him," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said Krauss.</p>

<p>"Kill him!"</p>

<p>"Sillier still," gasped Krauss. "Oh, this is terrible."</p>

<p>"Which way," said Crossley, "to the tallest building in town?"</p>

<p>"You go down to the next cornerâ€”" said the doctor and stopped. "No.
Stop. We must stop him."</p>

<p>"Get out of the way," said Crossley. "Here I go."</p>

<p>"But this is preposterous," screamed Krauss. "Doctor, we must think of
something!"</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Women sobbed in the streets, their hair trembling in their hands,
detached from their heads. Puddles formed wherever women met to weep.
See, see, my beautiful hair, fallen! <i>Your</i> hair, you butcher's
mate; what of mine? Mine! Yours was hempen rope, a horse's tail! But
mine, ach, mine! Like wheat in the high wind falling!</p>

<p>Crossley led the doctor and Krauss along a wide street.</p>

<p>"What goes on?" he asked naively.</p>

<p>"Beast, you know well enough," whispered the doctor fiercely. "My wife,
my beauteous Thickel, her blonde hair'll be a ruin!"</p>

<p>"Speak roughly to me again," threatened Crossley, "and I'll hurl myself
before this next bus."</p>

<p>"Don't, no!" cried Krauss, seizing his arm. To the doctor: "Fool. Is
your wife more important than hanging?"</p>

<p>"My wife is good as your wife," snarled the doctor. "Katrina and her
henna rinse!"</p>

<p>Crossley led the way into a building and up in an elevator. They walked
on a terrace on the thirteenth floor.</p>

<p>"It is a riot," moaned the doctor, surveying the street below. "The
women storm the beauty salons demanding help. I wonder if my Thickel is
with them, raging?"</p>

<p>In huge clusters the women of the city held their heads in their hands
as if they might topple and fall plunk on the ground. They argued,
phoned husbands in high government circles, sent telegrams to the
Leader, pummeled and kicked a bald man who laughed at them in their
misery.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Krauss," said Crossley. "There." He flicked a constellation
of dandruff from Krauss' lapel.</p>

<p>"My hair," said Krauss, in realization. "My lovely hair!"</p>

<p>"Will you sign peace terms, or shall I jump from this building and let
you and your wrathful wife become bald?"</p>

<p>"My wife," sobbed Krauss. "Bald! Ah, heaven!"</p>

<p>"Turn over all secret officers of your plan, admit your guilt in full,
and the attack will stop. You will keep your hair," said Crossley. "And
cure me of my fatal illness."</p>

<p>"That," said Krauss, "we cannot do. The illness, I mean. But the peace
terms, ah, my sweet, balding wife, the peace terms, I reluctantly
accept. Peace, it is."</p>

<p>"Fine," said Crossley. "But, one more term." He grabbed the doctor,
held him out over the edge, as if to drop him.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Frantically, the doctor squirmed. "I lied! We did nothing to
you. It was psychological. You'd have <i>worried</i> to death in ten
years!"</p>

<p>Crossley was so surprised he let go.</p>

<p>He and Krauss stared down at the dwindling doctor, falling.</p>

<p>"I didn't really mean to drop him," said Crossley.</p>

<p>"<i>Squish</i>," murmured Krauss, a moment later, looking down.</p>

<p>Crossley pushed his jet-ship homeward.</p>

<p>"Edith, it's over! The music'll be off in an hour!"</p>

<p>"Darling!" she radioed. "How'd you do it?"</p>

<p>"Simple. They thought it enough to irritate people. That was their
error. They didn't strike psychologically deep enough. Their type of
irritant only touched surfaces, made people madâ€”"</p>

<p>"And sleepy."</p>

<p>"But we attacked their ego, which was something else. People can stand
radios, confetti, gum and mosquitoes, but they won't take baldness or
turning yellow. It was unthinkable!"</p>

<p>Edith ran to meet him as he landed. The radio still hung in the garden,
drifting, singing.</p>

<p>"What do you make it, now?" he cried.</p>

<p>She kissed him.</p>

<p>Pulling back she counted swiftly inside her head, glanced at the
floating radio and said, automatically:</p>

<p>"That makes two thousand three hundred and <i>ten</i>!"</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
